SmartHostAI is a very smart co-host you wish to have in all your meetings. It transcribes meeting recordings, summarizes and sends the minutes of the meeting and creates action items automatically in GitHub/Jira.

## How to get started

1. Get the AssemblyAI API key for FREE (https://www.assemblyai.com/docs) and save the key in `config.py`   
```assemblyai_key = YOURKEY```
2. Install `streamlit` and `assembly-ai-plus` using `pip`.    
`assembly-ai-plus` is un-official `python` sdk for AssemblyAI, which I have created ðŸ™‚
3. Run the app the using the following command 
`streamlit run app.py`
